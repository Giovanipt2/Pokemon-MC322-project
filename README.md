# OOP-Pokemon-Tournament

This repository contains the implementation of a simple Pokémon tournament game, developed as a group project for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at Unicamp. The goal was to apply the main principles of the OOP paradigm in a complete and interactive application.

## Project Overview

The game is a single-elimination (knockout-style) Pokémon tournament designed for 4 players. Each player selects one starter Pokémon and three additional Pokémon. The tournament consists of two semifinals, a third-place match, and a final battle.

## Topics Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism  
- **Game Logic**: Turn-based battle mechanics and tournament structure  
- **Code Organization**: Modular design and clear separation of responsibilities  
- **Team Collaboration**: Development carried out in a team setting
